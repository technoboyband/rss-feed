# rss-feed

# Overview
This is a super simple script written in Ruby that prints out recent RSS feed items in your command line. It was meant to be an introductory project in Ruby to mess around with reading user inputs and learning some of the syntax so theres not much to it.

# Requirements
Ruby is required for this script to run.

# How to Use
Clone this repo and navigate to the 'rss-feed' directory. 

The script can be invoked by ```./rssParser.rb rssURL rssURL2 ...``` 

Ex. ```./rssParser.rb http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/feeds/news.rss https://archlinux.org/feeds/news/```
